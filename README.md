Description:

Bubble Bobble is an arcade game developed by Taito (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taito) in 1986 that was also realesed in a great amount of consols.

Each player can control one of two protagonists, Bub and Bob, two little dragons who set out to save their girlfriends from a world known as the Cave Monster. The game is divided into levels, in each of which Bub and Bob must defeat each of the enemies present by trapping them in bubbles, and popping them; earning bonus items. The game consists of 100 levels, each increasingly difficult.
